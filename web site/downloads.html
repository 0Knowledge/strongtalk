                (2.5MB) Release Date: July 1, 2002<br>
                <br>
                This is the original release from Sun
                Microsystems. There is rarely a reason to
                download this, since it does not work on Windows
                XP and has plenty of other niggling problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The software is free, and open source, under a BSD-style license. Sun's license is included in the download,
        however, if you'd like to look at it first, it is
        here:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
	<h2>Source Code</h2>
	<p>The source code for the Strongtalk VM has just been released as of September 10, 2006.  Development was halted on Strongtalk in the late 90s, so at the moment the source only builds and runs correctly
	    using old versions
	    of MS C++, and also requires Borland Turbo Assembler for the small
	    remaining amount of assembly code (parts of the interpreter). </p>
	<p>
	    Rather than wait until we can get the VM rebuilt and running using current
	    development tools, we are so excited about the source release that
	    we are pushing out the bits now for those who are interested, or
	    who want to help.  So here is the source code, but the binary releases were not built using this version of the source (although there are no functionality differences).</p>
