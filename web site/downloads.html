                <br>
                This is the original release from Sun
                Microsystems. There is rarely a reason to
                download this, since it does not work on Windows
                XP and has plenty of other niggling problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The software is free, and open source, under a BSD-style license. Sun's license is included in the download,
        however, if you'd like to look at it first, it is
        here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="license.html">Source License </a> </li>
        </ul>
	<h2>Source Code</h2>
	<p>The source code repository (under Subversion) can be found at: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/strongtalk/source">http://code.google.com/p/strongtalk/source</a>.</p>
	<h3>Pre-packaged Source</h3>
	<p>The source code for the Strongtalk VM has just been released as of September 10, 2006.  Development was halted on Strongtalk in the late 90s, so at the moment the source only builds and runs correctly
	    using older versions
	    of MS C++, and also requires Borland Turbo Assembler for the small
	    remaining amount of assembly code (parts of the interpreter). </p>

	<li><a href="downloads/strongtalk-source-1.0.1.zip"><strong>strongtalk-source-1.0.1.zip</strong></a>
                (3.7MB) - This is the original source release from Sun Microsystems.  The version number for this does not match any binary release, since this version does not build.</li>
