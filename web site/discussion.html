	<h2>Discussion Forum</h2>
	While there is no official support for
        the Strongtalk system, there is a Google discussion group 
        that can be used as a forum for questions and
        comments.  At least one of us plans on regularly
        responding to postings on the discussion group as
        necessary. The group is:<blockquote>
            <p><a
            href="http://groups.google.com/group/strongtalk-general">strongtalk-general</a></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Come on over and share your thoughts! If you are
        interested in Strongtalk, we would be more
        than happy to try to help you along.</p>
	<p>We are just starting to organize Strongtalk as an open source
		project, since the VM source has just been released.  If you
		are a VM or Smalltalk wizard, and are interested in helping
		out, now is the time to get in!</p>
