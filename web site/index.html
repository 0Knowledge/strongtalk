	<p><strong>Latest: Strongtalk has gone fully Open Source!</strong>
		The virtual-machine source code is now available, as of September, 2006. 

		Previously, the VM was available only as an unsupported
		binary, preventing serious use of Strongtalk.  Now,
		the sky is the limit!

	<h3>What Is Strongtalk? </h3>
	<p>Strongtalk is a major re-thinking of the Smalltalk-80
          programming language and system. While retaining the basic Smalltalk
          syntax and semantics, it contains a number of significant
          advances, including:
	</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong>
	    	It executes Smalltalk much faster than any other Smalltalk
                implementation, using an advanced inlining
                compiler based on <em>type-feedback</em>
                technology originally developed at Sun Microsystem Labs.  
		Remarkably, code is dynamically compiled and decompiled as necessary, 
		<em>even while it is running,</em> 
		in order to maintain perfect interpreted semantics.  Code can
		be transparently debugged and changed on-the-fly, yet will still run at 
		full speed.
	    </li>
	    <br />
            <li><strong>Type System: </strong>
	    	It contains the first fully developed strong, static type system
                for Smalltalk (hence the name <em>Strong</em>talk).
                The type system is both optional and incremental,
                and operates completely independently of the
                compiler technology (which means that normal
                untyped Smalltalk code runs just as fast as typed
                code). It also contains a re-designed,
                strongly-typed &quot;Blue Book&quot; class
                library.
	     </li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Strongtalk system was developed in secret in the
          mid-90's by a small startup company. Before the
          Strongtalk system could be released, the company was
          acquired by Sun Microsystems, Inc. to work on the Java®
          virtual machine. Development of Strongtalk was halted at
          that point, so very few people have ever had a chance to
          see the Strongtalk system in action.  This is highly unfortunate, since
	  Smalltalk is still a more elegant and advanced programming 
	  language than any existing mainstream programming language, and 
	  Strongtalk is by far the fastest implementation of Smalltalk ever.
	</p>

        <p>Fortunately, Sun Microsystems has graciously released Strongtalk
          as completely free, open-source software.  The
	  first release from Sun in 2002 did not include source code for the 
	  virtual-machine (which contains the compiler).  Only the binary was
	  released, rendering the system
	  unsuitable for any serious use, other than evaluation by 
	  researchers.  As of September 2006, this has been remedied with the new release, which contains full source.
	</p>
	<p>Strongtalk development was halted before it was fully productized, so considerable
	  work remains to polish-up Strongtalk before it is ready to
	  be used in real-world applications.   But with the release of the virtual-machine
	  source code, a whole new world of possibilities has opened up.  What
	  will become of Strongtalk?  Now, the answer is 
	  finally in the community's hands!
