#summary Collaborative notes on a preliminary port of the Squeak image to the Strongtalk VM

== Possible Approaches ==

  # Emulation of the Squeak VM
  # Porting the Smalltalk code
    # Minimal: changing 

== Differences to Investigate in the Language Models or VM Interface/Architecture ==
  * Language Model
    * Traits vs. Mixins?
    * Namespaces?
    * Lack of class instance variables in Strongtalk
    * differences in closure support: 
  * VM
    * support for #become:, use of Obsolete classes in Squeak?
    * plugins
    * process model
    * Does Strongtalk VM have enough reflective facilities now to support debugger?

== Other Issues to Investigate ==
